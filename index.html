<p> Both of the videos on learning have very similar points to make. One talks about how you must be in growth mindset
rather than a fixed mindset, what sets these apart is that people in growth mindset are open to challenging themselves
and are okay with being wrong. In the video about the trees he says that people don't learn as well if they just get the answer,
they need to think about the question first and then reflect on what they said once they know the answer in order to really learn it.
The people who choose to think about a problem first rather than just going to look for the answer would be considered to have 
what she calls a growth mindset. They both also talk about the differences in unintelligent and unknowledgeable, people need to see
that they are not dumb becasue they don't something others do. They simply haven't learned it yet, and with effort they can get to
the level of others. </p>
